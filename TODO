BioAI Project: Road Junction Optimization

1. Build custom route script which generate *lots* of routes the normal way, than deletes ALL routes which does not belong to a specific subsets
2. Bake custom function to change the road infrastructure
3. Build the main simulation wrapping logic which monitors crashes and stuff, keeping track of arrival delays and things like that.
4. Integrate a genetic AI which decides over junctions, whether a priority or unregulated_traffic_light is better.
	=> DECIDE A GENOTYPE!!!
5. Edit the AI to decide over different timings for traffic lights (again, genotype), with the consequent edit of the road-changer script to integrate traffic light programs (argh)
